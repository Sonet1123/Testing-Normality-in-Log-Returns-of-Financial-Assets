# Testing Normality in Log Returns of Financial Assets

This project explores the assumption of normality in the log returns of individual stocks and constructed portfolios ‚Äî a core principle in many mathematical finance models.

---

##  Project Objectives

1. **Test normality** of full-period log returns for 10 individual stocks, data generated using yfinance.
2. **Use rolling windows** to identify periods when returns appear Gaussian.
3. **Trim outliers** (top/bottom 1% and 3%) to improve distribution shape.
4. **Construct a portfolio** from trimmed, normally distributed assets.

---

## Key Results

- None of the full-period log return distributions were normal.
- XOM showed the most frequent local normality (80%+ of rolling windows).
- After 3% trimming, 5 stocks passed the Anderson-Darling test:  
  `JNJ, KO, NVDA, TSLA, XOM`
- A portfolio built from these trimmed returns **passed all normality tests**.
